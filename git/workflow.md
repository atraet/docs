# Git workflow

Steps:
- Create a new feature branch /branch off (from master branch)
- Make some changes to the branch
- Commit the changes
- Switch to master branch
- Pull (locally) changed from the feature branch
- Delete the feature branch
- Push changes from master to remote master (origin/master) with merge-request.
